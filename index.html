    <h1> MAILIL WOMEN GROUP/PROJECT</h1>
        <p> The MAILIL women's group/project is an inspiring initiative launched by the women of Turkana East in 2018 to provide support to the vulnerable community in the sub-county. The region, characterized by an arid climate, faces challenges in agricultural productivity and access to water resources, leading to a situation where many residents live below the poverty line and lack access to basic necessities. Women encounter significant obstacles in terms of education, employment, and decision-making within this context. </p>
